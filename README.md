# AutoGating-Plugin<br>

AutoGating-Plugin allows user to specify a percentage of population
they would like to view. This is done on the contour scale where populations 
are separated from eachother based on their frequency.  This forms a visual
contour plot of the levels of frequency.  

This plugin requires Flowjo v10.1r7 to be run.
